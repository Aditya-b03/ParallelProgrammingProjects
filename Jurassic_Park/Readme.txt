Program simulates and solves the Jurassic park problem using semaphores

for INPUT management:
        Programs take file input:
        File Name = "inp-params.txt"

        it takes P , C , lambdaP , lambdaC , k as input from input file respectively
        INPUT FILE should contain each as space separated values
        (example : "100 10 5 20 3" where 100 = K , 10 = N , 5 = lambdaP , 20 = lambdaC , k = 3 )
        
        P - number of passenger threads
        C - number of Car threads
        lambdaP , lambdaC - used to derive delay values using exponential distribution
        k - number of cycles each passenger makes

for Running the Program:
        use a Cpp compiler to compile the ".cpp" file 
        (example : g++ Assign4-Src-Es21btech11003.cpp )
        Program execution(example : ./a.out )
